This Script deletes all text frames that already assigned with selected paragraph style, super easy to use and smart saving a lot of time to get rid from unwanted text frames.

Note : if you have multiple paragraph styles in the same text frame, only the text assigned to the paragraph style selected will be deleted and text frame will still exist.
